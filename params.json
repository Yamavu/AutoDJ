{"name":"AutoDJ","tagline":"automatic playlist-generating and learning player","body":"AutoDJ is a program to play MP3 and OGG audio files. It remembers which files users played in what order and how often and saves this information to a MySQL database. Because of this the database not only stores the available MP3 files, but also in which combinations they can be played. You could call this a **dynamic playlist**.\r\n\r\nLater it uses this information to automatically determine which file to play after the current file without any user interference. Given enough information it behaves like a DJ, hence the name.\r\n\r\nAutoDJ is written in Java and depends on a MySQL or SQLite database. It uses the jaudiotagger library for extracting ID3-tags from MP3 files. jaudiotagger is released under the LGPL and can be downloaded [here](http://www.jthink.net/jaudiotagger/). For playback AutoDJ uses [MPlayer](http://www.mplayerhq.hu) in `-slave` mode. It also uses the Apache Commons [Codec](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-codec/) and [IO](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/), which are released under [Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) and included for your convenience.\r\n\r\nAutoDJ is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either [version 3 of the License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), or (at your option) any later version. \r\n\r\nAutoDJ is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
